// LINQ - Language Integrated Query //

// Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language.
// Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. 
// Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. 
// With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators. 
// he LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).
